# So ยง9.6.1 of the SKOS reference <https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#L3514> says that we should infer that the elements of a skos:memberList of a skos:OrderedCollection should also be related to said collection via skos:member, but laments that OWL has no way of expressing this. It turns out, though, that you can say exactly this in SHACL:

# can we do this with a triple rule?
<tag:intertwingler.net,2023:resolve-list> a sh:SPARQLRule ;
  sh:subject sh:this ;
  sh:construct "CONSTRUCT { $this itcv:handler ?h } WHERE { ?this itcv:handler-list/rdf:rest*/rdf:first ?h }" ;
  sh:condition [ sh:path itcv:handler-list ] .

# yes, we can
<tag:intertwingler.net,2023:resolve-list-triple> a sh:TripleRule ;
  sh:condition [ sh:path itcv:handler-list ] ;
  sh:subject sh:this ;
  sh:predicate itcv:handler ;
  sh:object [ sh:path ( itcv:handler-list [ sh:zeroOrMorePath rdf:rest ] rdf:first ) ] .

# Granted these examples aren't SKOS, but they consider the exact same problem.
