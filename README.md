# RDF::SAK — Swiss Army Knife for RDF(a) Content

```
$ rdf-sak
> some-command
some response!
> 
```

This is the beginning of a library, command line tool, and interactive
shell for Doing Things™ with RDF(a) content.

Right now there isn't much to look at but a
[whackload of comments](https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak/blob/master/lib/rdf/sak.rb).

## Documentation

None to speak of, but when there is, it will be generated and
deposited [in the usual place](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rdf-sak/).

## Installation

You know how to do this:

    $ gem install rdf-sak

Or, [download it off rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/rdf-sak)
(when I put it on there).
