# RDF::SAK — Swiss Army Knife for Semantic Web Content

This library can be understood as something of a workbench for the
development of a set of patterns and protocols for Web content—a
[content management
_meta-system_](https://doriantaylor.com/content-management-meta-system).
The proximate goals of this implementation are as follows:

* Durable addresses with fine-grained addressability of content,
* Adherence to declarative content models mediated by open standards,
* Easy content re-use, i.e., _transclusion_,
* Rich embedded metadata for search, social media, and other purposes.

`RDF::SAK` is also intended to serve as a substrate for:

* The maturation of a [content inventory
  ontology](https://privatealpha.com/ontology/content-inventory/1#),
* The use of semantic metadata [for manipulating content
  presentation](https://github.com/doriantaylor/rdfa-xslt),
* Development of a deterministic, standards-compliant, [client-side
  transclusion mechanism](https://github.com/doriantaylor/xslt-transclusion).

Finally, this library is also intended to establish a set of hard
requirements for the kind of RDF and Linked Data infrastructure that
would be necessary to replicate its behaviour in a more comprehensive
content management system.

The only public website currently generated by `RDF::SAK` is [my own
personal site](https://doriantaylor.com/), which I use as a test
corpus. However, this library draws together a number of techniques
which have been in use with employers and clients for well over a decade.

## ARCHITECTURE

maybe its own document? who knows!

* [ ] [notion of "source" and "surface"](https://rdf-sak.ibis.makethingsmakesense.com/95bab4f0-5b0d-42b5-a39d-768d1d725234)
  * [ ] we won't call it "origin" because that has special meaning
    * [ ] a "source" *can* be an "origin" but not necessarily (e.g. reverse proxy)
  * [ ] a source just has to take a URI and `Accept-*` header set (also `Authorization` if applicable) and return a representation
  * [ ] a "sink" is not the best word because a sink will actually *request* resources
    * [ ] instead we call it `Surface`
  * [ ] [so we implement the existing file system source as a `Source`](https://rdf-sak.ibis.makethingsmakesense.com/73409baf-2a94-4c6d-bbc9-54a7825009ab)
  * [ ] we implement the existing file system target as a `Surface`
    * [ ] [we change `write_to_target` to be something that the "sink" *pulls* rather than *pushes*.](https://rdf-sak.ibis.makethingsmakesense.com/3d348205-3878-4c60-9aa4-d8f16cddae91)
  * [ ] [we also implement the `Rack` app as a `Surface`](https://rdf-sak.ibis.makethingsmakesense.com/3cb7ab04-dd1a-443c-a5a3-8f43923ed0d7)
  * [ ] implement generated representations as "sources"
    * [ ] concept schemes (glossary/index/thesaurus)
    * [ ] bibliographies/book lists
    * [ ] rolodexes
    * [ ] document stats
    * [ ] rss/atom feeds
    * [ ] google sitemaps
    * [ ] arbitrary graph patches
* [ ] make any operation that can be made a pure function, a pure function
  * [ ] we want this because it's composable
  * [ ] most if not all ordinary web pages will probably have a sequence of stock transforms
* [ ] we want a command line shell
  * [ ] start daemon from shell?

## Future Directions

Ultimately, this implementation is disposable. What matter are the
patterns laid down in the program output. If these patterns can be
sufficiently normalized, then the behaviour ought to at least be
replicable in other content management systems. Failing that, the
patterns will serve as a set of requirements for future systems. The
ideal is that adherence to existing open standards plus a modest set
of additional constraints could, at least from the perspective of the
audience, make the CMS infrastructure disappear.

As for the texture and topology of the content itself, squaring away
the mundane problems of stable addressing, transclusion, and the
product-agnostic separation of content from presentation, the emphasis
on the _page_ as the basic unit of content can be subjected to further
scrutiny. The long-term goal of this project is a structure with
smaller nodes and many more links between them, something I am calling
_dense hypermedia_.

## How it Works

Because the focus of `RDF::SAK` is a corpus of interrelated Web
resources marked up just so, rather than presenting as an on-line Web
application, it instead both consumes and emits a set of static
files. It currently expects a directory of (X)HTML and/or Markdown as
its document source, along with one or more serialized RDF graphs
which house the metadata.

### Inputs

The files in the source tree can be named in any way, however, in the
metadata, they are expected to be primarily associated with UUIDs,
like the following (complete) entry:

### Outputs

The library has methods to generate the following kinds of file:

* (X)HTML documents, where file inputs are married with metadata
* Special indexes, generated completely from metadata
* Atom feeds, with various partitioning criteria
* Google site maps,
* Apache rewrite maps.

All files are generated in the target directory as their canonical
UUID and a representative extension,
e.g. `b5c16511-6904-4130-b4e4-dd553f31bdd8.xml`. Human-readable URIs
are then overlaid onto these canonical addresses using rewrite
maps. This enables the system to retain a memory of address-to-UUID
assignments over time, with the eventual goal to eliminate 404 errors.

Documents themselves are traversed and embedded with metadata.
Wherever possible, links are given titles and semantic relations, and
a list of backlinks from all other resources is constructed. There are
modules for generating various elements in the `<head>` to accommodate
the various search and social media platforms. The strategy is to hold
the master data in the most appropriate RDF vocabularies, and then
subsequently map those properties to their proprietary counterparts,
e.g., Facebook OGP, Schema.org (Google), and Twitter Cards.

> The latter representations tend to cut corners with various
> datatypes and properties; it's much easier to go from strict RDF to
> a platform-specific schema than it is to go the other way around.

#### Private content

While a fine-grained access control subsystem is decidedly out of
scope, `RDF::SAK` has a rudimentary concept of _private_ resources. A
resource is assumed to be "private" unless its `bibo:status` is set to
`bibo:status/published`. A document may therefore have both a public
and private version, as the private version may have links to and from
other documents which themselves are not published. Links to private
documents get pruned from published ones, so as not to leak their
existence.

### Running

I endeavour to create a command-line interface but the _library_
interface is currently not stable enough to warrant it. The best way
to use `RDF::SAK` for now is within an interactive `pry` session:

```bash
~$ cd rdf-sak
~/rdf-sak$ pry -Ilib
[1] pry(main)> require 'rdf/sak'
=> true
[2] pry(main)> ctx = RDF::SAK::Context.new config: '~/my.conf'
=> <RDF::SAK::Context ...>
[3] pry(main)> doc = ctx.visit 'some-uri'
=> <RDF::SAK::Context::Document ...>
[4] pry(main)> doc.write_to_target
```

A YAML configuration file can be supplied in lieu of individual
parameters to the constructor:

```yaml
base: https://doriantaylor.com/
graph: # RDF graphs
  - ~/projects/active/doriantaylor.com/content-inventory.ttl
  - ~/projects/active/doriantaylor.com/concept-scheme.ttl
source: ~/projects/active/doriantaylor.com/source
target: ~/projects/active/doriantaylor.com/target
private: .private     # private content, relative to target
transform: /transform # XSLT stylesheet attached to all documents
```

### Deployment

Deploying the content can be done with `rsync`, although it requires
certain configuration changes on the server in order to work properly.

In Apache in particular, rewrite maps need to be defined in the main
server configuration:

```apache
# one need not place these in the document root but it's handy for rsync
RewriteEngine On
RewriteMap rewrite  ${DOCUMENT_ROOT}/.rewrite.map
RewriteMap redirect ${DOCUMENT_ROOT}/.redirect.map
RewriteMap gone     ${DOCUMENT_ROOT}/.gone.map

# then we just add something like this to prevent access to them
<Files ".*.map">
Require all denied
</Files>
```

The rest of the configuration can go in an `.htaccess`:

```apache
# this redirects to canonical slugs
RewriteCond "%{ENV:REDIRECT_SCRIPT_URL}" ^$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} "^/*(.*?)(\.xml)?$"
RewriteCond ${redirect:%1} ^.+$
RewriteRule ^/*(.*?)(\.xml)?$ ${redirect:$1} [L,NS,R=308]

# this takes care of terminated URIs
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/*(.*?)(\..+?)?$
RewriteCond ${gone:%1} ^.+$
RewriteRule .* - [L,NS,G]

# this internally rewrites slugs to UUIDs
RewriteCond "%{ENV:REDIRECT_SCRIPT_URL}" ^$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/*(.*?)(\..+?)?$
RewriteCond ${rewrite:%1} ^.+$
RewriteRule ^/*(.*?)(\..+?)?$ /${rewrite:$1} [NS,PT]

# we can do something perhaps more elaborate to route private content
SetEnvIf Remote_Addr "31\.3\.3\.7" PRIVATE

# this splices in the private content if it is present
RewriteCond %{ENV:PRIVATE} !^$
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/.private%{REQUEST_URI} -F
RewriteRule ^/*(.*) /.private/$1 [NS,PT]
```

Configurations for other platforms can be figured out on request.

## Documentation

API documentation, for what it's worth at the moment, can be found [in
the usual place](https://rubydoc.info/github/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak/master).

## Installation

For now I recommend just running the library out of its source tree:

```bash
~$ git clone git@github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak.git
~$ cd rb-rdf-sak
~/rb-rdf-sak$ bundle install
```
