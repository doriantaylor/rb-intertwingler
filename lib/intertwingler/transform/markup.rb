# This class will probably be the template for
# {Intertwingler::Transform} going forward.
# {Intertwingler::Transform::Harness} is probably still useful for
# parts, as is the stuff for resolving transforms and parameters and
# partials and such.
#
# It took an extremely long time to settle on a design for the
# transforms. Originally I was imagining one class per transform, but
# hadn't completely worked out how they were going to be invoked.
# Around early July 2023 is when I decided to make everything an
# {Intertwingler::Handler} which interfaces exclusively by URL, and it
# made more sense to bundle transformation functions thematically,
# because they end up dealing with the same media types and therefore
# relying on the same dependencies. More to the point, the individual
# transforms are tiny pieces of code and there are a lot of them, so
# having a separate class for each is unnecessary clutter.
#
# As mentioned elsewhere, a transform responds exclusively to `POST`
# requests, and has a limited range of media types that it accepts and
# emits. Additional parameters are passed in via the URI query string.

  # This map routes URIs (UUIDs as single path segment) to internal
  # methods. We use UUIDs to decouple the identifiers that may show up
  # in configuration or path parameters from what we call the functions
  # internally. This structure also contains the accept and return types,
  # i.e., matching what comes in on the request's `Content-Type` header,
  # and offering results according to the request's `Accept` header,
  # respectively.
