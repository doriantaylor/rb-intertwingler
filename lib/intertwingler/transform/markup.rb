# This class will probably be the template for

# {Intertwingler::Transform::Harness} is probably still useful for
# parts, as is the stuff for resolving transforms and parameters and
# partials and such.
#
# It took an extremely long time to settle on a design for the
# transforms. Originally I was imagining one class per transform, but
# hadn't completely worked out how they were going to be invoked.
# Around early July 2023 is when I decided to make everything an
# {Intertwingler::Handler} which interfaces exclusively by URL, and it
# made more sense to bundle transformation functions thematically,
# because they end up dealing with the same media types and therefore
# relying on the same dependencies. More to the point, the individual
# transforms are tiny pieces of code and there are a lot of them, so
# having a separate class for each is unnecessary clutter.
#
# As mentioned elsewhere, a transform responds exclusively to `POST`
# requests, and has a limited range of media types that it accepts and
# emits. Additional parameters are passed in via the URI query string.

  # in configuration or path parameters from what we call the functions
  # internally. This structure also contains the accept and return types,
  # i.e., matching what comes in on the request's `Content-Type` header,
  # and offering results according to the request's `Accept` header,

    # okay so the problem is we need to do backlinks for not just the
    # document, but anything the document embeds. we propose to use
    # `id` attributes that match fragment identifiers in the embedded
    # graph data. so an element that has an `id` attribute *and* an
    # `about`/`resource`/`href`/`src` attribute is our de facto
    # container element. note that the root `<html>` element, the
    # `<head>` and its descendants, and the `<body>` all implicitly
    # take the document (or rather the content of `<base href="â€¦">`)
    # as the subject unless modified (e.g. with `about`).
    #
    # with those exceptions then, we can scan the document for
    # container elements. note that some container elements
    # (e.g. `<tr>`) will have a content model that does not permit
    # plunking a `<nav>` down into it, and so another strategy should
    # be chosen.
    #
    # again, if an element containing the role `ci:backlinks` is
    # already present in the subtree, we assume the origin or some
    # other transform upstream has already done the job for us for
    # that subject URI/container element.
    #
    # another thing to watch out for is the empty fragment, which is
    # distinct from the document. that can't have an `id` but it *can*
    # have an e.g. `about`. so the solution here would be to find the
    # outermost one (and if there are multiple outermost ones, we pick
    # either the first or last one of them).

    # PROCEDURE: scan every node that asserts a new subject for its
    # children (or has an id), perhaps with an xpath like
    # SUBJECT_XPATH above:
    #
    # /html:html/html:body|/html:html/html:body//html:*
    #  [@id|@about|@resource|@href|@src]
    #  [not(ancestor-or-self::*[@property and not(@content|@datetime)])]
    #
    # (should also add [self::sectioning-element|self::html:a])
    #
    # no wait a second, `<a>` can't have `<a>` descendants (which is
    # dumb frankly) so that rules it out
    #
    # valid elements look like: body, main, article, section, aside,
    # nav, header, footer, blockquote, figure, search,
    # div[not(parent::dl)]
    #
    # actually, do we *want* to include `href` and `src`? we are only
    # interested in block elements that don't have them (although <a>
    # can be coopted into one come to think of it).
    #
    # okay so here is the strategy: find the most "appropriate"
    # element for each subject:
    #
    # * first check if `@id` matches `@resource|@href|@src|@about` (in
    #   that order); if so this is it.
    # * otherwise if `@id` is present and matches the subject in an
    #   ancestor, this is it.
    # * otherwise if no node with `@id` is found, we want the
    #   "biggest" one that asserts the subject:
    #   * closer to the root ranks higher than farther down
    #   * closer to the front ranks higher than farther back
    #
    # subjects with zero elements appropriate for containing a block
    # of backlinks can be collated at the bottom as the last element
    # of the `<body>`.
