# This class encapsulates an individual (presumably generated) HTTP
# resource. It sits between an {Intertwingler::Handler} and whatever
# code generates the response's representation, and handles any
# preprocessing e.g. of query parameters or the request body. This
# class itself is an abstract superclass and is not meant to be used
# directly. Subclasses of this class are intended to be instantiated
# by a handler, when the handler itself is instantiated or otherwise
# refreshed.
#
# To use this class, subclass it and create a method with the same
# name as the request method except transliterated to
# `.downcase.tr_s(?-, ?_)` (so `GET` becomes `get`, or
# `VERSION-CONTROL` becomes `version_control`).  The method _must_
# return a {::Rack::Response} and _may_ raise an
# {Intertwingler::Handler::AnyButSuccess}.
