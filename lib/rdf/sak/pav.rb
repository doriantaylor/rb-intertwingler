      comment: %(PAV is a lightweight ontology for tracking Provenance, Authoring and Versioning. PAV specializes the W3C provenance ontology PROV-O in order to describe authorship, curation and digital creation of online resources.

          This ontology describes the defined PAV properties and their usage. Note that PAV does not define any explicit classes or domain/ranges, as every property is meant to be used directly on the described online resource.

      "dc11:description": ["PAV supplies terms for distinguishing between the different roles of the agents contributing content in current web based systems: contributors, authors, curators and digital artifact creators. The ontology also provides terms for tracking provenance of digital entities that are published on the web and then accessed, transformed and consumed. In order to support broader interoperability, PAV specializes the general purpose W3C PROV provenance model (PROV-O).\n\nPAV distinguishes between the data related to the digital artifact - named Provenance - and those related to the actual knowledge creation and therefore to the intellectual property aspects â€“ named Authoring. The Versioning axis describes the evolution of digital entities in time.\n\nUsing PAV, descriptions can define the authors that originate or gave existence to the work that is expressed in the digital resource (pav:authoredBy); curators (pav:curatedBy) who are content specialists responsible for shaping the expression in an appropriate format, and contributors (super-property pav:contributedBy) that provided some help in conceiving the resource or in the expressed knowledge creation/extraction.\n\nThese provenance aspects can be detailed with dates using pav:curatedOn, pav:authoredOn, etc. Further details about the creation activities, such as different authors contributing specific parts of the resource at different dates are out of scope for PAV and should be defined using vocabularies like PROV-O and additional intermediate entities to describe the different states.\n\nFor resources based on other resources, PAV allows specification of direct retrieval (pav:retrievedFrom), import through transformations (pav:importedFrom) and sources that were merely consulted (pav:sourceAccessedAt). These aspects can also define the agents responsible using pav:retrievedBy, pav:importedBy and pav:sourceAccessedBy.\n\nVersion number of a resource can be given with pav:version, the previous version of the resource with pav:previousVersion, and any other earlier versions with pav:hasEarlierVersion. Unversioned, 'mutable' resources can specify their current version as a snapshot resource using pav:hasCurrentVersion and list the earlier versions using pav:hasVersion.\n\nThe creation of the digital representation (e.g. an RDF graph or a .docx file) can in many cases be different from the authorship of the content/knowledge, and in PAV this digital creation is specified using pav:createdBy, pav:createdWith and pav:createdOn.\n\nPAV specializes terms from W3C PROV-O (prov:) and DC Terms (dcterms:), however these ontologies are not OWL imported as PAV can be used independently. The \"is defined by\" links indicate where those terms are included from. See http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o and http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/ for more details. See http://purl.org/pav/mapping/dcterms For a comprehensive SKOS mapping to DC Terms.\n\nPAV 2 is based on PAV 1.2 but in a different namespace ( http://purl.org/pav/ ). Terms compatible with 1.2 are indicated in this ontology using owl:equivalentProperty.\n\nThe ontology IRI http://purl.org/pav/ always resolve to the latest version of PAV 2. Particular versionIRIs such as http://purl.org/pav/2.1 can be used by clients to force imports of a particular version - note however that all terms are defined directly in the http://purl.org/pav/ namespace.\n\nThe goal of PAV is to provide a lightweight, straight forward way to give the essential information about authorship, provenance and versioning, and therefore these properties are described directly on the published resource. As such, PAV does not define any classes or restrict domain/ranges, as all properties are applicable to any online resource.\n\n--\n\nCopyright 2008-2014 Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Balboa Systems; University of Manchester\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

    property :authoredBy,
      comment: %(An agent that originated or gave existence to the work that is expressed by the digital resource.

The author of the content of a resource may be different from the creator of the resource representation \(although they are often the same\). See pav:createdBy for a discussion.

pav:authoredBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to also cover the creation of the representation of the artifact.

The author is usually not a software agent \(which would be indicated with pav:createdWith, pav:createdBy or pav:importedBy\), unless the software actually authored the content itself; for instance an artificial intelligence algorithm which authored a piece of music or a machine learning algorithm that authored a classification of a tumor sample.

The date of authoring can be expressed using pav:authoredOn - note however in the case of multiple authors that there is no relationship in PAV identifying which agent contributed when or what. If capturing such lineage is desired, it should be additionally expressed using PROV relationships like prov:qualifiedAttribution or prov:wasGeneratedBy.).freeze,

    property :authoredOn,
      comment: %(The date this resource was authored.

pav:authoredBy gives the authoring agent.

Note that pav:authoredOn is different from pav:createdOn, although they are often the same. See pav:createdBy for a discussion.

This property is normally used in a functional way, indicating the last time of authoring, although PAV does not formally restrict this.

The value is of type xsd:dateTime, for instance "2013-03-26T14:49:00+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime. The timezone information \(Z for UTC, +01:00 for UTC+1, etc\) SHOULD be included unless unknown. If the time \(or parts of time\) is unknown, use 00:00:00Z. If the day/month is unknown, use 01-01, for instance, if we only know September 1983, then use "1983-09-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime.).freeze,

    property :contributedBy,
      comment: %(The resource was contributed to by the given agent.

Specifies an agent that provided any sort of help in conceiving the work that is expressed by the digital artifact.

Contributions can take many forms, of which PAV define the subproperties pav:authoredBy and pav:curatedBy; however other specific roles could also be specified by pav:contributedBy or custom subproperties, such as illustrating, investigating or managing the underlying data source. Contributions can additionally be expressed in detail using prov:qualifiedAttribution and prov:hadRole.

Note that pav:contributedBy identifies only agents that contributed to the work, knowledge or intellectual property, and not agents that made the digital artifact or representation \(pav:createdBy\), thus the considerations for software agents is similar to for pav:authoredBy and pav:curatedBy.

pav:contributedBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:contributor - which might or might not be interpreted to also cover contributions to making the representation of the artifact.

      comment: %(An agent primary responsible for making the digital artifact or resource representation.

This property is distinct from forming the content, which is indicated with pav:contributedBy or its subproperties; pav:authoredBy, which identifies who authored the knowledge expressed by this resource; and pav:curatedBy, which identifies who curated the knowledge into its current form.

pav:createdBy is more specific than its superproperty dct:creator - which might or might not be interpreted to cover this creator.

For instance, the author wrote 'this species has bigger wings than normal' in his log book. The curator, going through the log book and identifying important knowledge, formalizes this as 'locus perculus has wingspan > 0.5m'. The creator enters this knowledge as a digital resource in the knowledge system, thus creating the digital artifact \(say as JSON, RDF, XML or HTML\).

A different example is a news article. pav:authoredBy indicates the journalist who wrote the article. pav:contributedBy can indicate the artist who added an illustration. pav:curatedBy can indicate the editor who made the article conform to the news paper's style. pav:createdBy can indicate who put the article on the web site.

The software tool used by the creator to make the digital resource \(say Protege, Wordpress or OpenOffice\) can be indicated with pav:createdWith.

The date the digital resource was created can be indicated with pav:createdOn.

      comment: %(This resource has a more specific, versioned resource with equivalent content.

This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract resource to a single snapshot that can be used as a permalink to indicate the current version of the content.

For instance, if today is 2013-12-25, then a News page can indicate a corresponding snapshot resource which will refer to the news as they were of 2013-12-25.

    <http://news.example.com/> pav:hasCurrentVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-25/> .

"Equivalent content" is a loose definition, for instance the snapshot resource might include additional information to indicate it is a snapshot, and is not required to be immutable.

Other versioned resources indicating the content at earlier times MAY be indicated with the superproperty pav:hasVersion, one of which MAY be related to the current version using pav:hasCurrentVersion:

    <http://news.example.com/2013-12-25/> pav:previousVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-24/> .

Note that it might be confusing to also indicate pav:previousVersion from a resource that has hasCurrentVersion relations, as such a resource is intended to be a long-living "unversioned" resource. The PAV ontology does however not formally restrict this, to cater for more complex scenarios with multiple abstraction levels.

Similarly, it would normally be incorrect to indicate a pav:hasCurrentVersion from an older version; instead the current version would be found by finding the non-versioned resource that the particular resource is a version of, and then its current version.

The subproperty pav:previousVersion SHOULD be used if the earlier version is the direct ancestor of this version.

This property is transitive, so it should not be necessary to repeat the earlier versions of an earlier version. A chain of previous versions can be declared using the subproperty pav:previousVersion, implying that the previous previous version is also an earlier version. It might however still be useful to declare an earlier version explicitly, for instance because it is an earlier version of high relevance or because the complete chain of pav:previousVersion is not available.

Note that pav:importedOn may overlap with pav:createdOn, but in cases where they differ, the import time indicates the time of the retrieval and transcription of the original source, while the creation time indicates when the final resource was made, for instance after user approval.

This property is normally used in a functional way, indicating the first import date, although PAV does not formally restrict this. If the resource is later reimported, this should instead be indicated with pav:lastRefreshedOn.

The source of the import should be given with pav:importedFrom. The agent that performed the import should be given with pav:importedBy.

See pav:importedFrom for a discussion about import vs. retrieval.

Note that it might be confusing to indicate pav:previousVersion from a resource that also has pav:hasVersion or pav:hasCurrentVersion relations, as such resources are intended to be a long-living and "unversioned", while pav:previousVersion is intended for use between permalink-like "snapshots" arranged in a linear history.  ).freeze,
