* generic engine behaviour
  - [ ] <<P001>> engine initializes with configuration
  - [ ] <<I001>> we don't want to run one of these things for each site, especially if they're sharing data. more redundant config plus moving parts to fail. if anything it should be /optional/ to run multiple daemons but not /necessary/.
    - [ ] <<P002>> engine must be configurable with arbitrarily many authorities (host:port pairs)
      - [ ] <<P003>> authorities dispatched by ~Host:~ request header
      - [ ] <<P004>> we should be able to alias authorities
  - [ ] <<I002>> we need a way for the static site generator to know in advance the files it has to write out.
    - [ ] <<P005>> engine responds with manifest of available URIs
      - [ ] <<P006>> manifest can be narrowed per site
      - [ ] <<P007>> manifest should be since whenever
  - [ ] <<I003>> we want the engine to have a standard interface.
    - [ ] <<P008>> engine main operation receives HTTP /request/ object
      - [ ] <<P009>> engine transforms request
        - [ ] <<P010>> rewrite headers
          - e.g. rewrite accept headers based on user-agent header
          - e.g. rewrite accept headers based on query parameter
        - [ ] <<P011>> rewrite request-URI (path + query parameters + /path/ parameters)
          - note: path parameters are UI/designators for response transforms
        - [ ] <<P012>> rewrite request method
        - [ ] <<P013>> rewrite request body
        - [ ] <<P014>> manipulate request transform stack
          - note: static configuration of response transforms will need to manipulate the request transform stack
            - e.g. markdown to (x)html transform: presence in the stack should insert a request transform that adds text/markdown to the request's accept header
        - [ ] <<P015>> manipulate source polling sequence
        - [ ] <<P016>> manipulate response transform stack
      - [ ] <<P017>> engine transforms response
  - [ ] <<P018>> engine main operation returns HTTP /response/ object
  - [ ] <<P019>> transforms must have access to graph
** source modules
   - [ ] <<I004>> how are we going to negotiate which source handles a request?
     - [ ] <<P020>> have the resolver append alternate URLs to the request object.
       - [ ] <<I005>> this entails subclassing the Rack request objects.
     - [ ] <<P021>> have the source modules register one or more URI schemes.
*** filesystem source
    - [ ] <<P022>> handle ~file:~ URIs
      - [ ] <<I006>> what about content negotiation?
        - [ ] <<P023>> we can just say that the filesystem has additional properties that cause it to respond to ~Accept-*~ headers.
        - [ ] <<P024>> implement 
*** content-addressable store
    - [[P021]]
      - [ ] <<P025>> handle ~ni:~ URIs
    - [ ] <<I007>> Store::Digest implements a ~/.well-known/ni/~ root and index pages that could/should be exposed
*** reverse proxy
    - [ ] 
*** RDF-based
** URI resolver
   - [ ] <<I008>> 
** transforms in general
   - [ ] <<I009>> how do we ensure transforms get executed in the right order?
     - [ ] <<P026>> create execution phases like apache
*** request transforms
    - [ ] <<I010>> Certain request transforms will elicit erroneous responses (ie they will return something other than what the client asked for) if they do not have a concomitant response transform.
      - [ ] <<P027>> make it so request transforms can conditionally push a response transform onto the stack.
        - [[I009]]
*** response transforms
    - [ ] <<P028>> map response transforms to content types.
    - [ ] <<I011>> certain response transforms will not make sense to run without a concomitant request transform having been run first.
      - [ ] <<P029>> have a way to pair request transforms to response transforms.
      - [ ] <<P030>> have a given response transform install its paired request transform?
* static site generator behaviour
  - [ ] <<P031>> generator initializes with configuration
** generator main function
   - [ ] <<I012>> we need a way for the static site generator to know in advance the files it has to write out.
    - [ ] <<P032>> generator receives manifest from engine
    - [ ] <<P033>> generator writes resources to disk
      - [ ] <<P034>> generator examines target mtimes
        - [ ] <<P035>> generator only overwrites files changed since last write
    - [ ] <<P036>> generator writes rewrite maps
    - [ ] <<P037>> generator writes site map
* "live" engine adapter behaviour
  - [ ] <<P038>> adapter initializes with configuration
  - [ ] <<P039>> adapter spawns daemon
    - [ ] <<P040>> daemon forks/threads as necessary (tunable in config)
    - [ ] <<P041>> daemon listens on a socket
* async daemon behaviour
  - [ ] <<P042>> async daemon initializes with configuration
  - [ ] <<P043>> async daemon runs plain command queue
    - [ ] <<P044>> queue has persistent state/resumes when interrupted
    - [ ] <<I013>> AMQP node?
  - [ ] <<P045>> async daemon behaves like ~at(1)~ (scheduled one-off commands)
  - [ ] <<P046>> async daemon behaves like ~cron(1)~ (scheduled repeating commands)
** pluggable operations
   - [ ] <<P047>> external link crawler
   - [ ] <<P048>> RSS/Atom feed poller
     - [ ] <<I014>> PSHB event handler via webhook?
     - [ ] <<I015>> polling cues from statistics/feed payload? (yeah right)
   - [ ] <<P049>> content-addressable store bulk scanner/compressor
* CLI behaviour
  - [ ] <<P050>> spawn daemon from CLI
  - [ ] <<P051>> run static site generator from CLI
** interactive shell
   - [ ] <<P052>> query and manipulate graph
     - [ ] <<P053>> shell interprets basic graph manipulation commands (as Turtle/SPARQL syntax)
       - [ ] <<P054>> autocomplete symbols
         - [ ] <<P055>> autocomplete all syntax
       - [ ] <<P056>> set prefix mappings
     - [ ] <<P057>> shell interprets SPARQL commands
   - [ ] <<P058>> load graph from file
     - [ ] <<P059>> auto-detect syntax
     - [ ] <<P060>> set default graph context (?)
   - [ ] <<P061>> dump graph to file
     - [ ] <<P062>> Turtle and others
   - [ ] <<P063>> find and tag jargon
     - [ ] <<P064>> must attempt to resolve to existing SKOS concepts or provide UI to create new ones
     - [ ] <<P065>> must write back to source
